# Service-catalog
*Service-catalog* is a centralized catalog of services allowing you to discover and manage services. The main idea behind this project design is simplicity. This repository is also the big part and the base for set of engineering thesis.\
The main advantage *service-catalog* delivers is simple overview of yours environment. Generally that's the tool to aggregate most important information about services and entities working in yours ecosystem. Those entries can be used as a basic knowledge base aimed for developers needs.\
Not only services can be stored. Websites, framework or ML models, all of those fit naturally to this tool. There is no difference in terms of ownership. Someone needs to be responsible for the product, someone needs to act as a product owner, and at the end someone needs to fix bugs. All this information are the part of every stored entry.
